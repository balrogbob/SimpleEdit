# SimpleEdit
Got Bored, decided to start with nothing and just code whatever came into my head. Turns out that was a python code editor to write the code for the editor I am writing. Has basic syntax highlighting, save and load functionality, and you can make text bold. ~~But you can't unmake it bold.~~ **YOU CAN NOW MAKE IT _UNBOLD_.** Also doesnt use any non-standard libraries, a fresh python install is enough. Uses Tkinter for GUI, and badly written unoptimized but threaded code to do the saving, loading, and highlighting.

If you are on windows, and don't mind a false positive on your AntiVirus, there is a windows executable in the repo. Runs on windows without needing to install python. (It has python inside it, pyinstaller is neet). You could, if you were a bit wierd, also run the exe under wine on linux and mac.
